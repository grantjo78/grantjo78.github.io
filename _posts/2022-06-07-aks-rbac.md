title: "AKS Lessons Leant - Azure RBAC with Azure AD integration not working"
categories: [AKS]
---

Last week I spent several hours troubleshooting an AKS problem for [Azure RBAC with Azure AD integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-ad-rbac). If I had read the documentation correctly the first time, because everything is there, that would have saved me several hours. This did highlight that I probably didn't understand Kubernetes RBAC as well as I should have. 

## The Problem

The problem that I was working on involved being able to grant an Azure AD Group, via Azure RBAC, permissions to manage resources within a specific namespace (e.g. the **voting** namespace)

As a Cluster Administrator I could see the namespace resources from both the Azure Portal and the CLI.

When I created a new role assignment with the *Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Writer* role and scoped it to the **voting** namespace (adding myself to the AD Group and revoking my Cluster Administrator permissions) I received an error message. 

From the Azure Portal I receievd a 403 error with the following message `namespaces is forbidden: User 'abc@123.com' cannot list resource "namespaces" in API group "" at the cluster scope. 'abc@123.com' does not have the required Kubernetes permissions to view this resource. Ensure you have the correct role/role binding for this user or group`

From the CLI the message was `Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "abc@123.com" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "voting"`

## Troubleshooting

I repeated the creation of the role assignment several times and even tried several other [roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/manage-azure-rbac#create-role-assignments-for-users-to-access-cluster) and scopes, all with the same result.

I decided to validate if the [Kubernetes role-based access control, with AD intregration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-ad-rbac) was working by using the below role and role binding. 

```
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: dev-user-full-access
  namespace: voting
rules:
- apiGroups: ["", "extensions", "apps"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
- apiGroups: ["batch"]
  resources:
  - jobs
  - cronjobs
  verbs: ["*"]
---
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: dev-user-access
  namespace: voting
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: dev-user-full-access
subjects:
- kind: Group
  namespace: dev
  name: <insert Azure AD Group Object ID>
```

After applying the role and role binding I was able to view resources within the **voting** namespace from the CLI.

However, when I tried to access the **voting** namespace from the Azure Portal I still received the *"namespaces is forbidden"* error message.

I checked the clusters configuration and could see that **Role-based access control (RBAC)** and **AKS-managed Azure Active Directory**  were enabled.

## The Solution

The solution was actually pretty simple, I hadn't [enabled Azure RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/manage-azure-rbac#create-a-new-cluster-using-azure-rbac-and-managed-azure-ad-integration) on the cluster.

This is not the same as **Role-based access control (RBAC)** or **AKS-managed Azure Active Directory** configuration options you would see during a cluster setup or in an existing cluster configurations.

![](/docs/assets/images/aks-rbac/aks-rbac-clusterconfiguration.jpg)

To [enable Azure RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/manage-azure-rbac#integrate-azure-rbac-into-an-existing-cluster) on my cluster I executed the following command 

```
az aks update -g <myResourceGroup> -n <myAKSCluster> --enable-azure-rbac
```

```
az aks update -g rg-aks-01-aue -n aks-cluster-01 --enable-azure-rbac
```

If I switch back to the Azure Portal, I can now see the pods.

If I attempt to deploy a pod into the **voting** namespace, the deployment will succeed.

If I attempt to deploy a pod into the **default** namespace, the deployment will fail as I do not have write permissions into that namespace.

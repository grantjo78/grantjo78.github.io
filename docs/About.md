Hello and welcome to my blog where I will be documenting my adventures. 

I decided to start this **new** blog for a number of reason:

1. To re-enforce concepts to myself by documenting what I have done
2. To share what I have learnt with others
3. To collect feedback from others to improve upon what I have done
4. I also decided to move my blog off WordPress and onto GitHub Pages with Jekyll (it's been a great learning experience)
5. And to have a bit of fun

Now for the [disclaimer](/docs/Disclaimer.html).

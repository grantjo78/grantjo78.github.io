# About This Blog

Hello and welcome to my blog. I will be using this blog to document my adventures in the cloud for both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

I decided to start this  blog for a number of:

To help re-enforce concepts to myself by documenting what I have done
To share what I have learnt with others
To collect feedback from others to improve upon what I have done
And to have a bit of fun

I'm not going to say that what I publish is the best way to do something but I will always look to improve and correct anything that I post.

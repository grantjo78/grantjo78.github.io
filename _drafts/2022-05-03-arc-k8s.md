In this series I'm going to be exploring Azure Arc-enabled Kuberneres. This article will cover: 
1. What is Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes?
2. The Environment
3. Arc-enabled Kubernetes - Azure Configuration
4. Arc-enabled Kubernetes - Agent Deployment and Configuration


## What is Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes

[Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes allows you to attach and configure Kubernetes clusters running anywhere. You can connect your clusters running on other public cloud providers (such as GCP or AWS) or clusters running on your on-premise data center (such as VMware vSphere or Azure Stack HCI) to Azure Arc.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview)

## Environment

Before I get started, I wanted to explain the environment that I will be working with.

### The Hyper-V Host

### Virtual Machines

### Kubenetes Environment

I decided to utilise [K3s](https://k3s.io/) to create my Kubernetes cluster as it's very quick to setup and lightweight. To setup the cluster is I utilised the K3s [quickstart guide](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/quick-start/).

My cluster consists of 2 nodes, a master (k3s-1) and a worker (k3s-2).



```
az extension add --name connectedk8s
```

k3s-admin@k3s-1:~$ az extension add --name connectedk8s

k3s-admin@k3s-1:~$ az login
